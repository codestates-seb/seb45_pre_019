          "questionProblem": "Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array? I tried switching around the order in which I ran my experiments, and used different seed for the random number generator, but the effect has been the same: searches in an unsorted array ran nearly twice as fast as the searches in the same array, but sorted! Does anyone have a good explanation of this strange effect? The source code of my tests follows; I am using .NET 4.0.",

          "questionProblem": "I have some questions regarding the relationship of drop/copy traits and ownership in Rust. The most important question: How do I know that a type is a type where the ownership rules apply? My best guess it is related to the lack of a copy trait. But I have never seen this stated explicity. Is this true? So my general question: If I have an assignment. One last note: The JoinHandle type lacks a drop trait - yet it is called an owned type. So I guess this points to the fact that a drop trait is not necessary for a type to be called an owned type. But is it sufficient? E.g. are all types with a drop trait owned types?",
